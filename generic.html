								<h2>Co-op Work Term Report 1&2</h2>
								<p>This page is dedicated to my Work term 1 & 2. Starting from May 2019 to December 2019 I was hired as a student consultant at the University of Guelph’s Computing and Communications Services department (CCS). Here I will give a breakdown of the department, my experience, and the results of my learning objectives. </p>

									<h3 class="major">About CCS</h3>
									<p>The Computing & Communications Services (CCS) manages all IT related services throughout the University campus at Guelph. They also provide support to Ridgetown and Guelph-Humber campuses. CCS assists faculty, staff and student and there are a wide range of departments to provide specific services to the appropriate clients. My role was within the CCS Help Centre, and we are the forefront of CCS. Any IT related concern comes through us either through in-person, an e-mail, or phone call. Some common tasks include: passwords resets, unlocking accounts, assisting with connecting devices to wifi, installing and troubleshooting software from our software distribution site, updating lists of recent spam on our phishing webpage, voicemail resets for faculty and staff, and we provide best effort help with laptops and mobile devices in person at our library help desk location. We can resolve most technical issues for students, but when the issue is beyond our capabilities (i.e for a staff member) then we create a ticket and assign it to the appropriate department.</p>

									<h3 class="major">Goals & Reflection</h3>
									<p>Goal #1: Oral Communication</p>

									<p>During the first week of my first work term I was slowly learning the services we provide for clients. As I began taking calls I noticed I was a little too dependant on my supervisor. I wanted to be able to have a fluid conversation without requiring assistance.</p>


									<p>Action plan: In the Help Centre, we have access to a Shared Drive that contains documents of common procedures. To become accustomed to the procedures I made it a habit to read through the documents during the slow times and after hours. Each call was usually unique so I made a document with a list of how to resolve less common issues. To measure my success I would like to be able to troubleshoot a technical issue without putting the client on hold and have a flowing conversation.</p>

									<p>Reflection: The first two months of working at the Help Centre was a little nerve racking. As it was the summer, a lot of our clients were staff and faculty and they are used to having their issues resolved immediately. Staff and faculty would usually call in regarding some software/portal that I was not familiar with yet, so calls were taking longer than I hoped. By reading the documents in our shared drive and getting familiar with the departmental software and tools resolving client issues got significantly easier. I began to become comfortable with the technical issues that clients came across. Most importantly, I began to stop panicking when a client had an issue I have never heard of. If the issue is not common, I put them on hold while I do a little research on the issue to figure things out. By the end of the term I was able to confidently troubleshoot and resolve technical issues on my own.</p>


									<p>Goal #2: Technological Literacy</p>

									<p>I want to become confident in troubleshooting various software issues and assist clients with using software.</p>


									<p>Action Plan: The CCS offers in person help at our IT Desk in the library. Our main initiative is to provide support for University related software and services, but as a bonus we assist with any technical related issue to the best of our ability. Like the Help Centre, clients approached us with both familiar and unique issues. I began noticing a pattern with the software clients requested help with. My goal was to become more confident in troubleshooting at the IT Help Desk, so I tested out the software clients often had trouble with. Some of these software were Office365 products, NVivo, SPSS and SASS. I wanted to upgrade my technical abilities to troubleshoot and problem solve quicker. To measure my success, I want to become more knowledgeable in a software beyond the comprehension I have now.</p>

									<p>Reflection: As the number of clients increased, I began noting down solutions to issues that occur with their respective software. For example, Office365 has difficulties activating the University’s license and clients are unable to use the products. The solution is to perform a SMC reset. Having these solutions noted has boosted my productivity at the IT Help Desk and I am able to troubleshoot without seeking assistance from our resources. Furthermore, it has significantly improved my collaboration with my coworkers as we share solutions w have come by. This process gets our team involved and we are able to benefit from each other.</p>

									<p>Goal #3: Leadership</p>

									<p>I want to be able to contribute to the Help Centre by working on something beneficial for the later team. </p>


									<p>Action plan: During the beginning of the work term my supervisor has mentioned opportunities to work on project work during our slow times. This can be range from documentation, research on new products for the help centre, updating CCS pages on the Guelph website. I want to make myself available to work on these tasks with the abilities that I have and will learn. For updating documentation I collected solutions that have yet to be documented. Additionally, I read through our current documentation to note whether updates need to be made. To measure my success, I want to be able to make an upgrade or addition to the tools (documentation, web pages, etc) that can help the later team.</p>

									<p>Reflection: As the term went on, the opportunity to partake in project work started to show up. Our team has a links page, which is a HTML page with links to resources and tools that we often use while assisting clients. I have had prior HTML/CCS experience before so my supervisor gave a couple of my coworkers and I the task to reorganize and update the page. My experience until now was solely personal projects while I was able to apply my technical knowledge on a professional level.</p>

									<h3 class="major">Job Description & Academic reflection</h3>

									<p>As a Student Consultant working at CCS, my main task was to provide IT support to clients. Both students and staff rely on CCS’ services. At the Help Centre I was responsible for answering calls and responding to tickets. I also worked at our IT Help Desk located at the library providing in person help to clients. The first procedure I was trained to do was resetting passwords, as this is the most common request from students. For students, most of the support they required was related to their account. As I had access to the database of all university related accounts, I was able to see what was preventing them from logging in. What was great about this position was the push to problem solve because the range of issues was wide. After the first few months I learned the bulk of the procedures but I still experienced many unique requests that I have not handled before. </p>

									<p>An enjoyable part of my job was coordinating with other CCS departments and learning about what they do. For example, when there is a building that is experiencing network issues I am required to collect information and pass it to our Network Infrastructure team. When there is a mass spam email sent to University related e-mails we are required to update the Spam & Phishing webpage informing clients not to trust the spam e-mail. </p>

									<p>When the day was moving slow, our supervisor gave us project work. Some tasks were to look through and update the documentation for procedures, updating our team HTML page with useful links, and doing research on products. This year, we implemented a chat so clients can request help live instead of creating a ticket or calling. </p>

									<p>The skillset required to perform at this job was not taught in the courses I have taken as the primary focus was soft skills and IT rather than programming. I do feel like I have gained a broader perspective of the professional work environment. The experience and skills I have gotten from assisting clients and problem solving will prove to be beneficial in my further opportunities. </p>

									<h3 class="major">Acknowledgements</h3>

									<p>I cannot thank my supervisor Jill Hogg enough. I'm very appreciative of the opportunity to work with CCS. She assisted me throughout the whole two terms and did everything to make sure we felt comfortable working. I would also like to thank Umer, Numan, Kathleen, Aleisha, and Ava for being awesome coworkers! It was such a pleasure to meet everyone and it made working at CCS that much more worth it. </p>
